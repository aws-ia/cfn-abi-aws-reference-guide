## Partner Workflow

AWS provides modules to enable AWS foundational services based on [AWS Security Reference Architecture (AWS SRA)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prescriptive-guidance/latest/security-reference-architecture/welcome.html) guidelines. 

Partners can pick these modules and add additional logic to perform remaining steps like enabling partner integration in Security Hub or registering AWS account to partner product.

Once the solution is built, the partner can submit a Git Pull Request (PR) to the repository created for this project. 

All the PRs will go through a set of auto validations built-in to the pipelines. On successful completion of validation, the code is merged to the main branch of the repository, and published.
