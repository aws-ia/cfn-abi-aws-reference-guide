* **ABI Modules :** The GitHub repositories based of AWS SRA, which provide templates for enabling AWS foundational services like CloudTrail, GuardDuty, SecurityHub and more security services.
* **ABI Projects :** The GitHub repositories built by Partners in partnership with AWS. While building these projects, partners leverage ABI Modules provided to enable AWS services as needed before creating partner specific assets. The project contains 1\ IaC templates to automate enablement of both AWS and Partner services, 2\ Wrappers for most common formats like CfCT manifest, SC Baselines and more to allow customers to easily pick and choose from the services available. For Pilot, we will focus only on including CfCT manifest file in the package.
